# Basic projects

This repository contains some of my initial projects developed during the beginning of my career. The projects are organized according to the languages that I have the most affinity with, and inside each section, according to their relevance and complexity.

**Disclaimer:** some of the projects were not entirely designed by me. I had help from several online tutorials.
