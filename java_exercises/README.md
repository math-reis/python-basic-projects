## Simple Programming Problems

A collection of progressively more difficult exercises made in Java.

### Elementary
- [x] 1. [Write a program that prints "Hello World!" to the screen.](https://github.com/math-reis/small-projects/blob/main/java_exercises/01.java)
- [x] 2. [Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.](https://github.com/math-reis/small-projects/blob/main/java_exercises/02.java)
- [x] 3. [Modify the previous program such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.](https://github.com/math-reis/small-projects/blob/main/java_exercises/03.java)
- [x] 4. [Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n.](https://github.com/math-reis/small-projects/blob/main/java_exercises/04.java)
- [ ] 5. [Modify the previous program such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17.]()
- [x] 6. [Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product the numbers 1 to n.](https://github.com/math-reis/small-projects/blob/main/java_exercises/06.java)
- [x] 7. [Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.]()
- [ ] 8. [Write a program that prints all prime numbers up to n.]()
- [ ] 9. [Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.]()
- [ ] 10. [Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.]()
- [ ] 11. [Write a program that computes the sum of an alternating series where each element of the series is an expression of the form ((−1)k+1)/(2*k−1)((-1)^{k+1})/(2 * k-1) for each value of kk from 1 to a million, multiplied by 4.]()


### Lists, Strings

- [ ] 12. [Write a function that returns the largest element in a list.]()
- [ ] 13. [Write function that reverses a list, preferably in place.]()
- [ ] 14. [Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a list.]()
- [ ] 15. [Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.]()
- [ ] 16. [Write a function that computes the running total of a list.]()
- [ ] 17. [Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.]()
- [ ] 18. [Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a for-loop, a while-loop and recursion. (Subject to availability of these constructs in your language of choice.)]()
- [ ] 19. [Write a function on_all that applies a function to every element of a list. Use it to print the first twenty perfect squares. The perfect squares can be found by multiplying each natural number with itself. The first few perfect squares are 1*1= 1, 2*2=4, 3*3=9, 4*4=16. Twelve for example is not a perfect square because there is no natural number m so that m*m=12. (This question is tricky if your programming language makes it difficult to pass functions as arguments.)]()
- [ ] 20. [Write a function that concatenates two lists. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]]()
- [ ] 21.
